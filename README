This portfolio has been created as part of my training at the SoftwareOne Academy. 
I have set myself as a limitation not to start from a classic design, use a monochrome 
color palette and not use any image or video. In this way, I have had to take full advantage 
of the stylistic possibilities of HTML, CSS and JS, making everything based on ASCII art. 
Making everything look like it was done with punched cards seemed like a good homage 
to that time when using images wasn't an option.
